# Mobile Contacts

This is a demo project. This project was made using Vanilla JavaScript and the styling using CSS Flexbox.

This project simulates the contacts' list in a mobile. At first the list shows all the contacts with the
name and phone number. A smooth animation is triggered as the contact cards are shown in the list. 

Then the user can search the contacts' list either by name or phone number. 

Depending on the keys pressed, the appropriate cards from the list will show. In addition as the user types
the string or the number in the search field, the corresponding strings or numbers in the cards will show bold.

Important Notice: All names and phone numbers used in this project are random and have nothing to do with real data.
